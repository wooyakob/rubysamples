almost every line of ruby code revolves around an object
what you do with objects is send them messages
the messages usually correspond to the names of methods you're asking the object to execute
ruby objects are usally handled by variables that represent them
bulk of design, logic and action revolves around objects
when writing ruby programs, main activities: creating obects, endowing them with abilities and asking them to perform actions
when you want something done:
    a calculation
    an output operation
    a data comparison
    you ask an object to do it
